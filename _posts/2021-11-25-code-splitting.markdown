Good morning! You just woke up and you're heading to the kitchen to make yourself a coffee &mdash; 1 cream & 1 sugar, the perfect cup. As you open the carton of cream, you notice a stench... It's expired! Why did this have to happen to me!? You realize it's because you left it out of the refridgerator for far too long when you bought groceries the other day.

## The other day...

You put all your groceries &mdash; including the cream into 1 big bag and drive back home. As you're struggling to take out the bag you notice your neighbour walking back and forth from their car to the door with much smaller bags. By the time you get to your door, they finished bringing in their stuff already. Because you took so long to bring in your groceries, the cream expired... a truely pitiful experience. In real life cream doesn't expire that fast, but on the internet, seconds can make a huge difference between a good experience vs a bad one. That's the main benefit of code splitting &mdash; speed.
